# API built on top of the [Hello World API](https://github.com/auth0-developer-hub/api_django_python_hello-world/tree/basic-role-based-access-control)

You can use this sample project to retrieve your tenant's applications, as well as the actions that apply to each application and the type of trigger each Action is bound to.

## Get Started

Prerequisites:
    
* Python >= 3.7

Initialize a python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup virtual environments:
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit it to populate its variables.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Run the following command to generate a random secret key and add it to your `.env` file.
```bash
python manage.py generate_secret

# .env
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<generated_key>
```

Run DB migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Run the project:

```bash
gunicorn
```

## API Endpoints

The API server defines the following endpoints:



> You need to protect this endpoint using Auth0.
